Report for a joint project in Applied Mathematics

## Embers

The main ember code results can be run by running `python3 ember_analysis.py` and then running `surfplot.m` in MATLAB.
Additional qualitative code is in extras. Unzip `embers/extras/data/data.zip` into the `data` folder before running `plotter.m` 
Parameters can be tweaked in `setup_module.init`.

## Wind 
Run `fire_driver_comp.m`.

## Combined Model

Run `python3 ember_wind_analysis.py` and `surfplot.m` for the quantitative analysis, and `python3 gridplot.py` for the qualitative analysis.
